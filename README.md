# Day Planner

This project is a day planner for the user to create and save their tasks for the day (from 9 AM to 5 PM). It is useful to keep track of their schedule. This project utilizes local storage to save the user's input to local storage when they select the save button so that the text will not be erased after refreshing the page. Moment.js and jQuery are used with the HTML and CSS to create the functioning planner.
